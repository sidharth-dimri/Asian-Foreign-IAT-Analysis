# Asian-Foreign-IAT-Analysis
Based on data collected from Harvard's Implicit Association Test, calculating changes in racial bias towards Asian-Americans from 2019 to 2021. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, racism against Asian-Americans increased heavily, while Asian-Americans were largely blamed for the onset of the virus. According to the Pew Research Center, about one third of Asian adults personally knew an Asian-American who was threatened or attacked because of their race/ethnicity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to see if this increase in racism was reflected in American society. I looked towards results of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which can be used to explain unconscious biases in a person. These unconscious biases are not necessarily reflective of one's actual beliefs, but rather of the society one lives in.

For this project, I used the Asian-American-Foreign test, which evaluated implicit bias between Asians and Europeans, testing subjects on whether they considered Asians or Europeans are more "American" or "foreign" than the other. I plan to look at the changes of IAT results between 2019 to 2021, testing to see if Asian-American's sense of being "American" has changed due to COVID-related discrimination, and thus by extension racism against Asian-Americans. I also looked at individual changes in IAT results between states to measure any geographical differences.

Unfortunately, I was unable to include the datasets I used due to file size.
