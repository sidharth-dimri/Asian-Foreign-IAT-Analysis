# Asian-Foreign-IAT-Analysis
Based on data collected from Project Implicit's _Implicit Association Test_, calculating changes in racial bias towards Asian-Americans from 2019 to 2021. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, racism against Asian-Americans increased heavily, while Asian-Americans were largely blamed for the onset of the virus. According to the Pew Research Center, about one third of Asian adults personally knew an Asian-American who was threatened or attacked because of their race/ethnicity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to see if this increase in racism was reflected in American society. I looked towards results of the _Implicit Association Test_ (IAT), which can be used to explain unconscious biases in a person. These unconscious biases are not necessarily reflective of one's actual beliefs, but rather of the society one lives in.

For this project, I used the Asian-American-Foreign test, which evaluated implicit bias between Asians and Europeans, testing subjects on whether they considered Asians or Europeans are more "American" or "foreign" than the other. I plan to look at the changes of IAT results between 2019 to 2021, testing to see if Asian-American's sense of being "American" has changed due to COVID-related discrimination, and thus by extension racism against Asian-Americans. I also looked at individual changes in IAT results between states to measure any geographical differences.

Although there is an Asian Attitude IAT, that measures biases towards Asians and Europeans by "good" or "bad" qualifiers, I decided to use the Asian-American-Foreign test, which was the only dataset out of the two to have data in the required time frame.

Unfortunately, I was unable to include the datasets I used in this repository due to file size.


I have linked the datasets that I used below:
